**My golf journey**

I began playing golf at 10 years old when my brother really began to enjoy the game himself. He needed a playing partner and that is where I came in. We fell in love with the game together, and the rest is history. 

For the next few years, I played with him and had so much fun. Neither of us had ever had any lessons, so we eanjoying our time together competing against the course and eachother came first. I played on my school's varsity team when I entered seventh grade. My first year, I came in second in the Secton IIV Sectional Tournament and then competed in the New York State Championships finishing in 90th out of 130 girls. The following two years were interrupted by the Covid pandemic, but when the Sectional tournament resumed in 10th grade, I came in first with a personal best score of 40~35~75. I finished in the top 1/3 of girls in the state tournament. This past fall, I moved to section II, a much more populated section in the Capital District, and finished in 6 after shooting 80. I will compete in the State Championships in the spring. 

This past summer also marked the first time I worked with my coach, Jonathan Yarwood. You can visit his page [here](https://jonathanyarwood.com/home-1). He has a great understanding of all levels of the game, working US Open champion, Michael Cambell, and gold-medalist, Nelly Korda, as well as elite junior golfers. I have not only improved my game with him, but also my understanding of the sport. I am excited to continue to work with him and improve my craft. 

**FUN FACT**
I have 2 holes-in-one!
