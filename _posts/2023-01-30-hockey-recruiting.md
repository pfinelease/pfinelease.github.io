**My hockey history**

I began skating when I was four years old and have loved the game ever since. I played on boy's teams until I was 14. This challenged me and forced me to play a quicker, more physical style that I appreciate today. 

I am currently playing for Adirondack United (ranked #1 high school team in the state) and my split-season team, Adirondack Northstars. Last year, my split-season team won the state tournament and lost in the National semifinal game. While I enjoyed our team success, coming up short has motivated me to be better this season. 

In the summers, I train with elite performance coach, Brett Leanord, in South Burlington, Vermont. You can view his website [here](https://leonardhockey.com/). 

I have played all positions (besides goalie) throughout my young career, but I like playing right-wing the most.
