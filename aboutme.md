My name is Tekla Fine-Lease. I am 16 years old and am currently a junior at Queensbury High School. I grew up in Essex, New York, but recently moved to Queensbury to attend school. I have two older brothers, John Anthony (Assumption College) and Paul (Middlebury College).

While I love to play golf, hockey, soccer, basketball, and more (you can visit my Golf and Hockey pages to learn more), I also enjoy gardening, cooking, and spending time with my rabbit, Nellie. 

I have my own garden at home that my brother helped me build. I grow zucchini, squash, tomatoes, herbs, cucumbers,peppers, and more. I also love propagrating new plants. Some of my favorites include my peace lily, ogre ear, money tree, and African violet. 

I love to watch cooking shows and then try to recreate the dish with my own twist. My favorite reality chef is Barefoot Contessa.
